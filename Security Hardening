Phase 1 – Account & Identity Hardening
Step 1: Disable Guest User Account (Completed – Keep)

Risk: Anonymous access, lateral movement, reconnaissance.

Additional Advanced Controls

Rename Guest account before disabling

Monitor Event ID: 4625 (Failed login attempts)

Alert if Guest account activity is detected

Step 2: Disable Default Local Administrator (Completed – Keep)
Advanced Security Improvements

Rename "Administrator" account before disabling

Audit any usage before disabling

Track privileged login events:

Key SIEM Events:

Event ID 4624 → Successful login

Event ID 4672 → Admin privileges assigned

Step 3: Create Unique Secure Administrator Account (Completed – Keep)
Upgrade to Enterprise-Level Practice

Instead of only creating:

New_admin

Apply:

Strong Admin Design Standard

Name: SecOps_Admin01

Password:

Minimum 15 characters

Mix of:

Uppercase

Lowercase

Numbers

Symbols

Add Extra Controls

Disable password change by non-admin

Enable:

"Password never expires" (ONLY for secured admin accounts)

Document admin creation in security log

Phase 2 – Privileged Access Protection (NEW – ADVANCED)
Step 4: Restrict Remote Access (Enhanced)
Basic step already done:

Restrict RDP

Allow only new admin account

ADVANCED HARDENING
1) Limit RDP via Firewall

Allow RDP only from:

SOC network

Admin workstation IP

2) Change Default RDP Port (3389)

Attackers constantly scan this port.

3) Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)

Path:

System Properties → Remote → Advanced
4) Enable RDP Login Auditing

Track:

Event ID 4624 (Success)

Event ID 4625 (Failure)

Event ID 4778 (Session reconnect)

Phase 3 – Brute Force Protection (Enhanced)
Step 5: Configure Account Lockout Policy (Completed – Upgrade)
Recommended Enterprise Values
Setting	Recommended
Lockout threshold	5 attempts
Lockout duration	30 minutes
Reset counter	15 minutes
Advanced Add-Ons

Enable:

Audit Account Logon Events
Audit Logon Events

Purpose:

Detect brute force attacks

Feed alerts into Splunk

Phase 4 – Service Attack Surface Reduction (Enhanced)
Step 6: Disable Unnecessary Services 
High-Risk Services to Review

Disable if not needed:

Remote Registry

Telnet

SMBv1

Print Spooler (on non-print servers)

Windows Error Reporting

Bluetooth Support Service

Advanced Control

Set Startup Type:

Manual / Disabled
Phase 5 – Advanced Hardening
Step 7: Enable Windows Defender Advanced Protection

Enable Real-time protection

Enable Cloud protection

Enable Controlled Folder Access

Step 8: Enable Security Auditing Policies

Path:

Local Security Policy → Advanced Audit Policy

Enable logging for:

Logon events

Account changes

Privilege use

Process creation

These logs are CRITICAL for SIEM detection.

Step 9: Enable PowerShell Logging (SOC-Level Control)

Attackers use PowerShell heavily.

Enable:

Module logging

Script block logging

Transcription logging

Benefits:

Detect malware activity

Track attacker commands

Step 10: Disable USB Storage Access (Optional – Enterprise)

Prevents:

Data exfiltration

Malware via USB

 Phase 6 – SIEM Integration Readiness

After hardening, ensure logs are forwarded to Splunk:

Monitor These Critical Events:
Event ID	Description
4624	Successful login
4625	Failed login
4720	New user created
4726	User deleted
4732	User added to admin group
4740	Account locked

This connects:
Server Hardening → Detection → SOC Investigation

Security Improvements Achieved

After applying advanced hardening:

Default attack paths removed

Privileged access protected

Brute force resistance increased

Remote attack surface reduced

Insider threat visibility improved

SIEM monitoring strengthened
